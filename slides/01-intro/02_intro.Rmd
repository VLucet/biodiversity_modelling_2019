# Biodiversity scenarios


**DEFINITION**: 

*Quantitative estimates of the future trajectories of biodiversity* [Pereira et al. 2010]

# Metrics of biodiversity changes

- Species extinctions
- Species abundance and community structure
- Habitat loss and degratation
- Shifts in the distribution of species and biomes

# Suite of modeling techniques

# Species extinction

---

# Species extinction
## Differences among scenarios

- Land use and climate change scenarios
- Lack of understanding species ecology (e.g. migration)
- Differences between modeling approaches

---

# Conclusion

Scenarios must move beyond illustrating the potential impacts of global change on biodiversity toward more integrated approaches that account for the feedbacks that link environmental drivers, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and socioeconomic dynamics.

# The program for the week

--- 

# General objective

We are aware that the background, expertise and interest of everyone is very different. The diversity of techniques and approaches is almost as diverse as natural systems. So, our general goal this week is that everyone learns and make some progress in their understanding of biodiversity modeling.

--- 

# Specific objectives

1. Learn about and use different modeling techniques (statistical, differential equations, stochastic simulations)

2. Use climate change scenarios as input to biodiversity models

3. Use empirical data to perform biodiversity scenarios

4. Understand the limits and the uncertainty in biodiversity projections

5. Modeling is not only techniques, it's a state of mind and an approach to learn about a system

--- 

# Content 

1. Biodiversity and climate modeling
2. Species distribution
3. Communities
4. Spatial dynamics
5. Model integration and optimization

---
