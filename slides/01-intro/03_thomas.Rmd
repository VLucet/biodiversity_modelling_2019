# Research objective 

Provide a first pass estimate of extinction probabilities (species "commited to extinction") associated with climate change scenarios for 2050.

- Queensland: mammals (11), birds (13), reptiles (18)
- Australia: butterflies (24)
- Mexico: mammals (96), birds (186) and butterflies (41)
- South Africa: mammals (5), birds (5), reptiles (26) and butterflies (4)
- Europe: birds (34)
- Brazil : plants (163)
- South Africa : protoaceae (243)
- Europe : plants (192)
- Amazon : plants (9)

# Methods
## Estimating species extinction

Method 1 : $E_1 = 1 - (\sum A_{new}/\sum A_{original})^z$
(overal change in area) 

Method 2 : $E_2 = 1 - [(1/n)(\sum A_{new}/A_{original})^z]$
(average proportional change in area)

Method 3 : $E_3 = (1/n) \sum (1-A_{new}/\sum A_{original})^z$
(specific change in area)

# Conclusions

- Projections vary with methods, organisms and areas of the world
- Comparison with extinctions from habitat losses only reveals that some areas have larger climate change impacts, others are driven by land-use changes

# Reactions ?

# Commentary by Thuiller et al.
## Two additional sources of uncertainty

- Different SDMs
- Link between area reduction and extinction risk is questionable
