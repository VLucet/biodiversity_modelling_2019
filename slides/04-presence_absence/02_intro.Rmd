# Introduction
## What do we want to do when modelling species distribution?
The goal of an SDM is to find out where and/or when a species occur.

Often maps are the only output of SDMs but they should not be!

# Question to ask yourself when modelling a species

## 1. Why do you want to model the distribution of the species?

- To know where the species can be found now?
- To know where the species was found in the past?
- To know where the species will be found?
- To better understand the factor influencing the species distribution?
- To protect the species?
- To eradicate the species?
- etc.

# Question to ask yourself when modelling a species

## 2. What species data do you have to construct your model?

- Presence-only data for the species of interest?
- Presence-absence data for the species of interest?
- Presence-absence data for the multiple species?

## 3. What other information do you have to construct your model?

- Explanatory variables (climate, soil, ...)
- Expert maps
- Sampling intensity
- Sampling bias
- etc.

# Question to ask yourself when modelling a species

## 4. How do you want to model the distribution of the species?

- I am an expert, I will just draw a map freehand!
- Which model will be used? (This depends on the type of species data)
